Visual Schedule
===============
- I have found it helpful to have a screen that just shows my schedule as I work each day.

- Just create your own schedule csv based on `this template. <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O-Ixi8d5Gf1nmgDBYvxo0RLJXK1R2jfMXBvSlnuaFuU/edit?usp=sharing>`_

Screens
=======

There are two screens. Clicking switches to the other one.

Screen 1: Full Schedule
